Additional information

   I want to craft great software alone or with teams whose members skills and talents fit together well.  Ten years of building large and complex WEB applications plus a natural talent for programming turned me into the software developer I could not have imagined when I began programming years ago. My ability to build very large and complex web applications naturally implies that I welcome the  challenges of realizing daring ideas. That is aside from the opportunity of learning something new ,which every new challenge brings. Needless to say that I also have a thorough grasp of the HTTP protocol and how to develop WEB services using SOAP or Restful. I do not only build my beauties in record time but also build them by nothing less than the cleanest code. It is enough to say that the softwares I build just works. That is great for me, great for my clients and great for my past employers.
